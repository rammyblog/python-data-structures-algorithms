    "## Introduction\n",
    "Data items are represented within a computer as a sequence of binary digits. To distinguish between the different types of data, the term type is often used to refer to a collection of values and the term data type to refer to a given type along with a collection of operations for manipulating values of the given type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages provides data types as part of the language itself. These data types are known as primitives, and they come in two category simple (Integer and real types) and complex (Lists, strings, dictionaries & objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primitive types provided by a language may not be sufficient for solving large complex problems. Thus, most languages allow for the construction of additional data types, known as user-defined types since they are defined by the programmer and not the language. Some of these data types can themselves be very complex.\n"

    "An abstract data type (or ADT ) is a programmer-defined data type that specifies a set of data values and a collection of well-defined operations that can be performed on those values.\n",

    "This separation is typically enforced by requiring interac-\n",
    "tion with the abstract data type through an interface or defined set of operations. This is known as information hiding .\n",
    "User programs interact with instances of the ADT by invoking one of the several operations defined by its interface. The set of operations can be grouped into four\n",
